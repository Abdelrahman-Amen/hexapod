## About the STL files in this repository

Some of the parts have multiple versions with slight differences. But all of them are compatible and should work.  
Make sure to check all of them to pick the one that works for you before committing to the print.  
I use the latest version of each part in my own hexapod, which is the one with the higher number at the end of its name.

## Compatible fan-made 3D printable parts

Check out [this](https://github.com/almelnz2005/hexapod) repository which contains modified (but compatible) versions of the original parts which uses metal horns, M3 screws and seperated components to make the parts more 3D printer friendly. This is especially helpful if you are printing with material other than PLA and have issues with supports or shrinking.
